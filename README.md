# __IOC-Hunter__
 
 ## __Introduction:__
 -------------
 This Repository will be a tool that is used to pull the most recent verified IOC's from the last 24 hours from [ThreatFox](https://threatfox.abuse.ch)  and then pivot with this information using other sources such as VirusTotal to create a Workflow

## __Requirements:__
--------------
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebooks
* VirusTotal Api Key

## __VirusTotal Widget:__
--------------
The NBViewer does not allow for Interactive widgets to run, so a GIF was made to demonstrate how to use the VirusTotal Hash Report Widget.
